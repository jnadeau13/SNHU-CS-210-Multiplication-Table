# SNHU-CS-210-Multiplication-Table

# Scenario:
Begin by opening a Visual Studio project file that has correctly combined C++ and Python, which you already set up in a previous module. Remember you will be working in Release mode rather than Debug mode for this work because it includes Python. Next, add the code from the CS210_Starter_CPP_Code and CS210_Starter_PY_Code files in the appropriate tabs of your project. Be sure you have already reviewed the Module Six Assignment Video or its transcript, as they contain important information regarding what is included in the starter code. Understanding the starter code will help you effectively build off the C++ and Python components you have been given in order to complete the design of a simple math-based program.

The simple math-based program you create will need to be able to print the multiplication table for a given number and double the value of a given number.
